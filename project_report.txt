PROJECT REPORT: Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (Baseline Outputs)

1. DATA
- multivariate_series.csv (6 features, 2500 timesteps)

2. BASELINE (fallback due to missing PyTorch in environment)
- Baseline predictions generated using repeated weekly pattern + small trend extrapolation.
- This is a deterministic baseline used to produce submission-ready outputs when PyTorch is unavailable.

3. EVALUATION
- Test RMSE: 6.5931
- Test MAE: 5.2264

4. FILES
- multivariate_series.csv
- test_predictions_sample.csv
- evaluation_metrics.csv
- (No trained PyTorch model could be created in this environment due to missing libs; include model training in your local/GPU environment if needed.)
